      <h3>Trying to slow down</h3>
      <p class="post-meta">Mood: tired</p>
      <p>
        My to-do list never ends and I keep saying yes to everything.
        I am worried that if I rest, things will fall apart, but I am also
        exhausted all the time.

          It is okay to rest before everything is finished. You are allowed to be
          a person before you are productive.

      <h3>New city, new loneliness</h3>
      <p class="post-meta">Mood: lonely</p>
      <p>
        I moved for school and everyone else seems to have found their group already.
        I talk to people in class, but it still feels like I am on the outside.

          Making real friends takes longer than social media makes it seem.
          You are not late, you are just human.

      <h3>Afraid of disappointing people</h3>
      <p class="post-meta">Mood: anxious</p>
      <p>
        I am scared to set boundaries because I do not want people to think I am
        selfish. Even small decisions make me nervous.

          Saying no is not selfish, it is a way of being honest. People who care
          about you will want you to feel safe and comfortable.

        <h3>Small good thing</h3>
        <p class="post-meta">Mood: hopeful</p>
        <p>
          I cooked myself dinner for the first time this month. It was simple,
          but it felt like proof that I can care for myself.

        <h3>Gentle reminder</h3>
        <p class="post-meta">Mood: reflective</p>
        <p>
          My therapist told me that progress is not always visible. Sometimes the
          win is that an old situation feels a tiny bit less unbearable.

          Reading other people’s posts makes me feel less strange. It helps to
          know that being overwhelmed is a common part of being human.
