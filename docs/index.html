      <h2>Welcome to CalmSpace</h2>
      <p>
        Life can feel heavy sometimes. CalmSpace is a small, supportive corner of the web
        where you can write down what is on your mind and read how others are coping
        with similar feelings. Our goal is not to replace professional mental health
        care, but to offer a gentle moment of connection.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can post anonymously, browse our community board, and leave short, kind
        replies for others. Even a few words like “I hear you” or “You are not alone”
        can make a difference.

      <h3>How It Works</h3>
      <p>
        CalmSpace is built around three simple ideas: write honestly, read gently,
        and reply kindly. Posts on the Community Board are short reflections about
        stress, loneliness, confusion, or small moments of hope.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can browse existing posts and, if you feel comfortable, leave a few
        supportive words. Even a sentence or two can help someone feel seen.

      <h3>Safety &amp; Care</h3>
      <p>
        CalmSpace is not a crisis hotline and cannot replace therapy or medical care.
        If you are in immediate danger or feel unable to keep yourself safe,
        please contact your local emergency services or a trusted mental health professional.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you write or reply, please be respectful. We encourage non-judgmental,
        gentle language and ask you not to share identifying details.

      <h3>Why This Project Exists</h3>
      <p>
        This website was created as a student project to explore how web design can
        support emotional well-being. The layout, colors, and typography are chosen
        to feel soft and approachable, while remaining accessible on phones and laptops.
